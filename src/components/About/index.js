            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>I'm 23 years old. I've spent 15 of those years in Utah, 6 in Washington State and the last 2 in Russia as a Missionary.
             I've been intersted in programming for a long time now and am excited to begin expanding my knowledge.
              I took a JavaScript class in highschool where I made a few games including a fully functional Yahtzee style game.
            I am currently enrolled in a Web Development Bootcamp through The University of Utah which I will graduate from in July, 2021.</p>
