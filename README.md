# react-portfolio ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Description 
  This is my first from-scratch react app. Learning react has been a ton of fun and I'm finding that I really enjoy it, there's so many possibilities with it. In this specific instance I learned a lot about how to use hooks, specifically the useState. Learning jsx formatting was simple and easy and it makes a lot of sense. This particular app is an SPA (Single Page Application) which means that it's all produced from one html file and the components on the screen are rendered conditionally based on what is selected in the nav-bar.
